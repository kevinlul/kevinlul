### Hi there 👋

🌃 What are we searching for among the stars and the moon, in this unseen universe? \
🌕 To what lays beyond understanding in the darkness / Both you and I kneel before it \
🌌 Spun with threads of light, surely the universe will consume us \
🕊️ But still, I want to believe that we'll be able to reach \
✨ The glory that waits in the unreachable future.
